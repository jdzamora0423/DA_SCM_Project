Analyzing Data for different scenarios for my Data Analytics in Supply Chain Management class

### CNC Machine
Not included in this repository due to data privacy reasons. Compared the performance of different models such as Random forest, XGBoost, KNN, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM for predicting processing time and average power consumption for a CNC machine. 

### Shipment Optimization
Used same modeling pipeline from scenario 1 with improvements, using GridSearchCV to predict shipping time; as well as adding classification models to determine optimal shipment mode for a shipping company.

### Furniture Sales Analysis
Compared the performance of different models such as Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters and LSTM for a time series data to predict sales performance of a furniture company; also applying the Apriori algorithm for association analysis of frequent item sets.
